## Why?

Modern Vim distributions are really huge and bloated with way too many fancy features
that you won't ever use or need, for example directory trees like Nerd tree, you
don't need a tree, you can view a project structure with fzf which is faster and has search.
Another example is [ThinkVim](https://github.com/hardcoreplayers/ThinkVim) has a
separate extension for formatting while also having ALE which can do that as
well, this double functionality is very common, thats one of the things this
distro avoids, KISS!

## Features

- Single file (you don't want your dotfiles to be all Vim script)
- Super minimal (~400 lines)
- Super fast startup (less than 40ms!)
- Lazy loading plugins
- Highly customizable
- Beautiful [Material ocean](https://github.com/material-ocean/Material-Ocean) color scheme
- Various IDE features via [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
- Smooth Scrolling (its really smooth!)
- Fully integrated with fzf (see [demos](#demos))
- Live Markdown preview
- Simple, Intuitive shortcuts

### Supported Languages

Neovim provides support for a wide range of languages by default.

## Requirements

- Linux (not tested on other platforms)

- Properly set up environment

## Setup

To check if your current environment is correctly set up run `:CheckHealth`.

### Environment

- python3: `pip3 install --user pynvim`
- javascript: `yarn global add neovim`

### Tools

- [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) (not required but Recommended)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (not required but recommended)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- clang (much better C and C++)
- [fuzzy finder (fzf)](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

- [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) python formatting

## Installation

After installing the requirements:

- `git clone https://github.com/Blacksuan19/init.nvim ~/.config/nvim`
- Start `nvim` and it will do the rest
- press enter if there are any errors (don't worry its fine)

## Plugins

Thanks to vim-plug the plugins are lazy loaded (anything that is not needed for
the current buffer is not loaded) for example opening a python file means all
other non python related plugins are not loaded.
Coc extensions are lazy loaded as well, they work the same way as vim-plug plugins.

## Customizations

Since the file is pretty small its very easy to interpret by even those who
don't have any knowledge about vim script, most of the sections have comments
about their functionality, and can be removed, commented out or swapped easily,
there are some defaults that are not everyone's cup of tea (after all this is
highly opinionated).

- **Disabling Plugins:** comment out the plug's 'Plugin/name' line from config and also remove the
  plugin settings

- **Disabling CoC Plugins:** comment out the plugin from `coc_global_extensions` variable and
  uninstall it via `:CocUninstall` plugin name

- **Installing CoC plugins:** open `:CocList` and search for marketplace, you can find all
  available plugins here

- **Adding Bookmarks:** to add bookmarks to the start page, find `g:startify_bookmarks` in
  `init.nvim` and add the new bookmark just like the already present ones, the dictionary
  key is the shortcut you will use to quickly jump to that folder from the start page and
  the value is the path to targeted folder

for more customizations read throw the config file, there are comments everywhere and its
easy to interpret, you can also checkout the linked github page for each plugin for even
more options.

## Credits

All the Credit goes to the Neovim team for making most of the extensions
possible and better (async), and to all the plugins developers, and the hackers
who spend time Finding good shortcuts and tricks to make this an even more
superb experience.
